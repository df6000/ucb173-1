                        <p>In class we have discussed a number of possible approaches to creating a score, ranging from traditional musical notation to more free graphic forms of notation, to scientific notation and computer code.  For this project, I want you to create a score.  The piece which it describes should involve sound production on some level, even if the 'sound' it inspires is 'silent' or an unorthodox interpretation or critique of sound production.</p>
                        <p>I want you to perform this score -- outside of class -- and I want you to document a performance of this score.</p>
                        <p>In class, I want you to present both the score and the documentation of the performance of the score, together, as a single piece.</p>
                        <p>This relationship, between a generative idea, an actual realization of this idea, and a documentation of the realization of this idea, is fertile territory!  My goal with this piece is that you explore this territory, that you conceptualize this piece as an opportunity to utimately present a piece which exists in the gallery space, but not fully.  A piece which will be inherently completed by your audience, as they attempt to understand the relationship between these various components and attempt to understand/recreate a performance which they will never have the opportunity to experience, because it is always already gone.</p>
                        <p>Good luck and let me know if you have any questions!</p>
