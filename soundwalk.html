                        <p>Our first project will be a soundwalk.  What is a soundwalk?  A soundwalk is many things to many people.  We discussed some in class and there are a few examples listed on the syllabus (9/1).  Our soundwalk is going to be slightly more invasive than the definition that Hildegaard Westerkamp uses in her text, "soundwalking" -- we are going to augment or modify an experienced environment.  You should make an audio piece of 2-5 minutes (talk to me if you want to go longer or shorter), designed for playback either on headphones or on portable speakers.  In either case you will choose a place or places for us to experience your work, and your sounds will interact with and modify our experience of that space.  You may ask us to walk while we listen, and guide us along a specific path.  BUT YOU MAY NOT TALK ABOUT YOUR PIECE EITHER BEFORE OR DURING OUR LISTENING, so any verbal instructions should be recorded an included in your piece.  You may choose to lie to us, you may choose to create an imaginary space, you may choose to reveal a truth to us, you may use documentary audio (actualities), you may record the environment we are in and alter it, you may introduce unusual sounds into that environment, you may use sounds that you record or sounds that other people have recorded, you may create music using sonic pi or some other tool and include that in your piece, youmay use sound effects....I could go on and on.  The choice is yours to make!  Make something interesting and open our ears!  Please be sure to put your finished project on class shares in the 'project1' folder, no later than 5 pm on 9/19.  Good luck!</p>
